Appendix C: Roles
This Appendix is designed to assist in determining which competency and associated Knowledge and Skills are required by a particular role. Knowledge is the theoretical or practical understanding of the competency.
Please note that there is no hierarchy within the Knowledge and Skills. No Knowledge or Skill is of greater value than another. The first Knowledge and Skill listed within the knowledge unit has no order preference on those Knowledge and Skills listed elsewhere in list.
Additionally, the generic roles and job titles used within this Appendix may or may not be the same as the roles or job titles used by and individual Agency or organization. The ones used within this Appendix are a sample of current jobs/roles within various Federal Organizations and organizations at the time of publication. Using the competencies and functions, each of these samples can be tailored to meet the roles within a specific Agency.
Roles for highly specialized areas are not covered. The roles, and associated knowledge and skills should be tailored by the Agency.
All roles should have training on the Overall Knowledge and Skills as described within Appendix C, Competencies, Knowledge and Skills Catalog. These are the fundamental basis of knowledge/skills required for all jobs and roles.
Abilities are not covered in this document. Abilities are the specific skills that are obtained while on the job using the knowledge and skills that were obtained during the role-based security training. Therefore, it is assumed that abilities cannot be taught, but rather acquired throughout the employee’s career.
The format is as follows:
•	Function Area: This area corresponds with Appendix A: Function Areas. Appendix A provides a general description of the area and the Learning Objectives for those functions. The roles described within this appendix are within a function;
•	Role Area: This describes the overall role;
•	Roles: A list of various job title /roles is provided to assist in determining who should receive this role based training;
•	Responsibility: Defines the activities and or responsibilities of that particular role;
•	Knowledge Unit: Identifies the competencies associated with the role. The entire listing of the knowledge units and their associated knowledge and skills are located in Appendix B: Knowledge and Skills Catalog; and
•	Corresponding Knowledge and Skills Table: This table provides a breakdown of the specific knowledge unit, the corresponding knowledge and skills to each competency. Each role has various knowledge units associated with it. There are 4 differing functional perspectives that
 
correspond with the job title to allow for further tailoring of role-based training to better match with the job role. These areas are defined as follows:
o	Manage – those knowledge and skills particular to those employees who are responsible for management (e.g., managers, team leads, project managers)
o	Design – those knowledge and skills particular to those employees who are responsible for design activities (e.g., system developers, engineers)
o	Implement – those knowledge and skills particular to those employees who execute implementation (e.g., system administrators, network administrators)
o	Evaluate – those knowledge and skills particular to evaluation activities (e.g., testers, security analysts)


To assist with the tailoring of the training or to identify courses/modules that may have already been developed, there is the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies (NICCS) Portal. The government developed the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies (NICCS) to make cybersecurity information and materials more readily-available. NICCS underscores the four components of the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) and serves as a national resource for government, industry, academia, and the general public in their quest to learn about cybersecurity awareness, education, careers, and workforce development opportunities. The portal links to various courses or modules in cybersecurity that have been previously developed and can be reused. The URL is: http://niccs.us-cert.gov
